## About the connector
Illumio that provides a platform designed to help organizations protect their critical applications and data by creating secure zones and controlling access between workloads, regardless of whether those workloads are on-premises or in the cloud. This connector facilitates automated operations related to workloads, IP list and labels.
<p>This document provides information about the Illumio Core Connector, which facilitates automated interactions, with a Illumio Core server using FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks. Add the Illumio Core Connector as a step in FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks and perform automated operations with Illumio Core.</p>
